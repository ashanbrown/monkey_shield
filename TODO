- note you need to context switch yourself if the clashes come throuhg includes and not direect method overwrites

- assume whole file is single context, simplifies everything
  - change tests to use eval with fake filename

- think of way to automatically detect what needs to be context switched on
  - needs to take into account all the ancestors and lookup rules... not worth it??
    - example: each_char in some included Iterator classes + each_char in String class directly
