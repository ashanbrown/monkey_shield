- instead of replacing module_funcion after using it, we should just have a contatn flag set to turn it on and off
- Thread.new should copy context stack from the thread which spawned it

- fix problem methods
  - methods deifned in a module which call super... unfixable??
- think of way to automatically detect what needs to be context switched on
  - needs to take into account all the ancestors and lookup rules... not worth it??
    - example: each_char in some included Iterator classes + each_char in String class directly
